## 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone without any help...

### General
    
	
    Why Python programming is awesome
    What are sets and how to use them
    What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
    When to use sets versus lists
    How to iterate into a set
    What are dictionaries and how to use them
    When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
    What is a key in a dictionary
    How to iterate over a dictionary
    What is a lambda function
    What are the map, reduce and filter functions

### Requirements

Python Scripts
    
	Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc

C
    
	Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
    All your files should end with a new line
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded
